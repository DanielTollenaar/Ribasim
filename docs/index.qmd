title: "Bach"

Bach is a water resources model, designed to be the replacement of the regional surface
water module Mozart in the Netherlands Hydrological Instrument (NHI). Bach is still a work
in progress, it is a prototype that demonstrates all essential functionalities.

Bach is written in the [Julia programming language](https://julialang.org/) and is built
on top of the [SciML: Open Source Software for Scientific Machine Learning](https://sciml.ai/)
libraries, notably [ModelingToolkit.jl](https://mtk.sciml.ai/stable/).

# Status

The initial focus is on being able to
reproduce the Mozart regional surface water reservoir results. Each component is defined by
a set of symbolic equations, and can be connected to each other. From this a simplified
system of equations is generated automatically. We use solvers with adaptive time stepping
from [DifferentialEquations.jl](https://diffeq.sciml.ai/stable/) to get results.
