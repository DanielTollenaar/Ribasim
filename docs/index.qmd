Bach is a water resources model, designed to be the replacement of the regional surface
water modules Mozart and SIMRES in the Netherlands Hydrological Instrument (NHI). Bach is
a work in progress, it is a prototype that demonstrates all essential functionalities.
Further development of the prototype in a software release is planned in 2022 and 2023.

Bach is written in the [Julia programming language](https://julialang.org/) and is built
on top of the [SciML: Open Source Software for Scientific Machine Learning](https://sciml.ai/)
libraries, notably [ModelingToolkit.jl](https://mtk.sciml.ai/stable/).

# Status

The initial focus is on being able to
reproduce the Mozart regional surface water reservoir results. Each component is defined by
a set of symbolic equations, and can be connected to each other. From this a simplified
system of equations is generated automatically. We use solvers with adaptive time stepping
from [DifferentialEquations.jl](https://diffeq.sciml.ai/stable/) to get results.

# Introduction
## Water balance equations

The water balance equation for a drainage basin [@enwiki:1099736933] can be
defined a first-order ordinary differential equation (ODE), where the change of
the storage $S$ over time is determined by the inflow fluxes minus the outflow
fluxes.

$$
\frac{\mathrm{d}S}{\mathrm{d}t} = Q_{in} - Q_{out}
$$

We can split out the fluxes into separate terms, such as precipitation $P$,
evapotranspiration $ET$ and runoff $R$. For now other fluxes are combined into
$Q_{rest}$. If define all fluxes entering our reservoir as positive, and those
leaving the system to be negative, all fluxes can be summed up.

$$
\frac{\mathrm{d}S}{\mathrm{d}t} = R + P + ET + Q_{rest}
$$

Such a water balance ODE can be represented in ModelingToolkit.jl as follows:

```julia
using ModelingToolkit

@variables t S(t) R(t) P(t) ET(t) Q_rest(t)  # independent and dependent variables
D = Differential(t)       # define an operator for the differentiation w.r.t. time

sys = ODESystem([D(S) ~ R + P + ET + Q_rest])
```

On the last line, an `ODESystem` is created that consists of a single equation. Before we
can solve this, we need to create an `ODEProblem`, that provides information about the
timespan of the simulation, as well as the initial conditions.

Bach can be used as a Julia package running in a Julia session or as an
application initialized via TOML configuration files. Both uses are
demonstrated in the demonstrations.

## Time

The water balance equation can be applied on many timescales; years, weeks, days or hours.
Depending on the application and available data any of these can be the best choice.
In Bach, we make use of DifferentialEquations.jl and can use any of its [ODE solvers](https://diffeq.sciml.ai/stable/solvers/ode_solve/).
Many of these solvers make use of adaptive time stepping, which means the solver will
decide how large the time steps can be depending on the state of the system.

The forcing, like precipitation, is generally provided as a time series. Bach is set up
to support unevenly spaced timeseries. The solver will stop on timestamps where new forcing
values are available, so they can be loaded as the new value.
 
Bach is essentially a continuous model, rather than daily or hourly. If you want to use
hourly forcing, you only need to make sure that your forcing data contains hourly updates.
The output frequency can be configured independently. To be able to write a closed water
balance on e.g. a daily basis, we integrate the timeseries over the days. This way any
variation inside of the days is also included, and we can output in `m³` rather than `m³s⁻¹`.

## Space

The water balance equation can be applied on different spatial scales. Besides modelling a
single lumped watershed, it allows you to divide the area into a network of connected
representative elementary watersheds (REWs) [@REGGIANI1998367]. At this scale global water
balance laws can be formulated by means of integration of point-scale conservation equations
over control volumes. Such an approach makes Bach a semi-distributed model. In this document
we typically use the term "basin" to refer to the REW. (In Mozart the spatial unit was called
Local Surface Water (LSW)). Each basin has an associated polygon, and the set of basins is
connected to each other as described by a graph, which we call the network. Below is a
representation of both on the map.

![Mozart Local Surface Water polygons and their drainage.](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4471859/185932183-62c305e6-bc14-4f3c-a74c-437f831c9145.png)

The network is described as graph. Flow can be bi-directional, and the graph does not have
to be acyclic.

```{mermaid}
graph LR;
    A["basin A"] --- B["basin B"];
    A --- C["basin C"];
    B --- D["basin D"];
    C --- D;
```

Internally a directed graph is used. The direction is defined to be the
positive flow direction, and is generally set in the dominant flow direction.
The basins are the nodes of the network graph. Basin states and properties such
storage volume, wetted area are associated with the nodes (A, B, C, D), as are
most forcing data such as precipitation, evaporation, or water demand. Basin
connection properties and interbasin flows are associated with the edges (the
lines between A, B, C, and D) instead. 

Multiple basins may exist within the same spatial polygon, representing
different aspects of the surface water system (perennial ditches, ephemeral
ditches, or even surface ponding). @fig-p, @fig-s, @fig-t show the primary,
secondary, and tertiary surface waters in the Hupsel basin (as defined in the
Mozart LSW's). These systems may represented in multiple ways.

![Hupsel: primary surface water.](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13662783/187625163-d0a81bb6-7f55-4ad1-83e2-90ec1ee79740.PNG){#fig-p}

![Hupsel: secondary surface water.](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13662783/187625170-1acdfb41-7077-443f-b140-ae18cbf21e53.PNG){#fig-s}

![Hupsel: tertiary surface water.](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13662783/187625174-3eec28b5-ddbb-4870-94c3-d9e9a43f8eb4.PNG){#fig-t}

As a single basin (A) containing all surface water, discharging to its
downstream basin to the west (B):

```{mermaid}
graph LR;
    A["basin A"] --> B["basin B"];
```

Such a system may be capable of representing discharge, but it cannot represent
residence times or differences in solute concentrations: within a single basin,
drop of water is mixed instantaneously. Instead, we may the group primary (P),
secondary (S), and tertiary (T) surface waters. Then T may flow into S, S into
P, and P discharges to the downstream basin (B.)

```{mermaid}
graph LR;
    T["basin T"] --> S["basin S"];
    S --> P["basin P"]; 
    P --> B["basin B"];
```

As each (sub)basin has its own volume, low throughput (high volume, low
discharge, long residence time) and high throughput (low volume, high
discharge, short residence time) systems can be represented in a lumped manner;
of course, more detail requires more parameters.
