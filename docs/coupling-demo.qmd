## Test cases

In our test cases, we will work with the Dutch national groundwater model
(LHM). For testing, we simplify the top boundary conditions to just three
surface water "systems", from large to small:

1. Primary
2. Secondary
3. Tertiary

These systems are separated in the groundwater model schematization due to the
relatively small size of the surface waters (several meters in width) in
comparison with relatively coarse cells of the groundwater model (250 m): most
cells in the LHM contain more than one surface water, and are included via
representative parameters which take the physical scaling into account. In case
of sufficiently small cell sizes, no overlap occurs and all surface waters can
be represented in a single grid.

Bach has no knowledge of these systems unless explicitly separated into
different (sub-)basins. In the examples below, these three systems are
represented by one basin with a single volume. For the purposes of testing, we
have not yet created empirical volume-level relationships for the surface water
of every cell extracted from a hydraulic model. Instead, we have chosen an
(over)simplified parametrization of the hydraulic properties, which makes it
easy to verify the behavior of Bach and the coupling procedures:

1. Primary, secondary, and tertiary systems have a rectangular profile: the
  area of the surface water does not change with water level or volume.
2. Water depth is constant for a system within a basin.
3. Water depth increases linearly with volume. (This follows from 1.)
4. Water depth is distributed across the systems in a geometric progression:
  when the tertiary system contains 0.1 m of water, the secondary system contains
0.2 m, and the primary system contains 0.4 m.
5. Water depth is 0.0 m for all systems when basin volume is 0.0. (This follows from 4.)
6. The distribution of water occurs according to the surface water area (width
  times length) used for the LHM parametrization of river bed conductance.

For freely draining basins, a simplified storage-discharge relationship has
been derived as follows:

1. The area of the basin polygon has been multiplied by 1 mm/d (roughly the
average precipitation excess in the Netherlands). This yields a "normative
discharge".
2. A corresponding normative volume has been chosen, corresponding with water
depths of 0.4, 0.2, and 0.1 m for the primary, secondary, and tertiary surface
waters respectively.
3. A dead storage volume has been chosen, corresponding with water depths of
0.2, 0.1, and 0.05 m for the primary, secondary, and tertiary surface waters
respectively. The basin only starts discharging when the storage volume exceeds
this value.

:::{.callout-note}
Bach is not limited to such oversimplified parametrization! Bach uses
tabulations and therefore supports arbitrary (piecewise linear) volume-depth
and volume-discharge relationships.

A visual representation of this simplified conceptual schematization is given
in @fig-volume-depth and @fig-volume-discharge.

An example of the resulting parameters for a single cell is shown in
@tbl-hupsel-v-h. The first row shows the water levels when the basin is empty.
The level for primary, secondary, and tertiary are equal to the bottom
elevation of the surface waters. The second row shows the volume and levels for
water depths of 0.4, 0.2, and 0.1 m. The third row shows the volume and levels
for a tenfold larger volume. This results in implausible water levels with
depths of 4.0, 2.0 and 1.0 m; the water level in the primary system is over
two meters higher than in the tertiary system. In reality, the surface waters
would overflow and surface ponding would occur; this mechanism is ignored
in the test cases for the sake of simplicity.

@fig-grid-volume shows the volume of the first row of the cell based
input for the primary system. Symbology is set to unique values. While water
levels differ per cell in this parametrization, the "normative volume" defined
above is shared by all cells in a basin.

@fig-grid-volume shows the water level corresponding to the normative storage
volume based input for the primary system (it corresponds to the value shown in
the first row of the primary colum in @tbl-hupsel-v-h). We see a clear gradient
from west to east: as our simplified parametrization assumes a constant water
depth for all cells in a single system, water levels spatially fall and rise
with the bottom elevation.

# Test case: Hupsel

To test the coupling, the following simulations have been setup and run:

1. A standalone MODFLOW6 run of sequential steady-states (i.e. no storage) with
  differing groundwater recharge values.
2. A coupled run where the MODFLOW6 stages are updated through the

From these tests, we expect the following behavior:

1. Drainage terms should remain largely the same when the water level is lowered in a steady-state:
  the amount of recharge is fixed, and this is locally drained.
2. In case of negative recharge (evapotranspiration), infiltration occurs in the surface waters.
  Infiltration should be zero when the basin volume is 0.

Figure ... shows the water balance of steady-state for submodel of the
LHM that has been by selecting the cells belonging to the district containing
the Hupsel catch, the Berkel. The Hupsel basin show the expected behavior:
in terms of incoming flows, most is precipitation with a minor part lateral
inflow from higher areas. In terms of outgoing flows, most of the precipitation
ends up in the surface water, primarily in the many ditches of the tertiary
system. Only a relatively small part of the water leaves the basin via the
groundwater. Interbasin flows through the groundwater form such a minor role,
as the aquifer is thin and transmissivity is limited.

## Budgets

Table ... shows the budgets computed by MODFLOW6 per primary, secondary, and
tertiary system. These are compared to the budget computed by the coupling
procedure, which uses equation ...

As expected, these numbers match exactly.

## Zero volume

# Test case: de Tol

Figure ... shows the water balance of steady-state for a submodel of the LHM
for the Polder de Tol and its surroundings. While groundwater recharge is the
dominant in going flow, lateral groundwater flow (over the entire depth of
the groundwater model) is a sizable inflow for the area; the larger lateral
inflow shows that De Tol is a net receiver of groundwater. In contrast to the
Hupsel, the tertiary system is almost entirely absent: drainage occurs not
through ephemeral tertiary ditches, but by the permanently water-bearing
ditches of the primary and secondary system instead. 

Currently, ModelingToolkit takes control of the timestepping. At specified
times, basin volumes are converted to MODFLOW6 boundary condition levels (via
so-called ContinuousCallbacks), and the groundwater equations are solved to
convergence. The drainage and infiltration budgets are then aggregated per
basin, and set for Bach. Bach then proceends with the next timestep.
